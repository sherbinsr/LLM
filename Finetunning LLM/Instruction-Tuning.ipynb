      "Training a dog to sit on command is a basic obedience command that can be achieved with patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to train your dog to sit on command:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Choose a quiet and distraction-free area: Find a quiet area with minimal distractions where your dog can focus on you.\n",
      "2. Have treats ready: Choose your dog's favorite treats and have them ready to use as rewards.\n",
      "3. Stand in front of your dog: Stand in front of your dog and hold a treat close to their nose.\n",
      "4. Move the treat up and back: Slowly move the treat up and back, towards your dog's tail, while saying \"sit\" in a calm and clear voice.\n",
      "5. Dog will sit: As you move the treat, your dog will naturally sit down to follow the treat. The moment their bottom touches the ground, say \"good sit\" and give them the treat.\n",
      "6. Repeat the process: Repeat steps 3-5 several times, so your dog learns to associate the command \"sit\" with the action of sitting.\n",
      "7. Gradually phase out the treats: As your dog becomes more comfortable with the command, start phasing out the treats. Instead, use praise and affection as rewards.\n",
      "8. Practice, practice, practice: Practice the \"sit\" command in different locations, with different distractions, and at different times of the day. This will help your dog understand that the command is universal and applies in all situations.\n",
      "9. Be consistent: Consistency is key when training a dog. Make sure everyone in the household is using the same command and reward system.\n",
      "10. Be patient: Training a dog takes time and patience. Don't get frustrated if your dog doesn't pick up the command immediately. Keep practicing and eventually, your dog will learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, training a dog is a journey, and it's important to be patient, consistent, and positive. With time and practice, your dog will learn to sit on command and other basic obedience commands.\n"

      "1. The `BinarySearchTree` class has a `root` field that represents the root node of the tree.\n",
      "2. The `nodes` field is a list of all nodes in the tree.\n",
      "3. The `insert` method takes an `int` `key` and an `int` `value` as parameters, and inserts the `value` into the tree at the appropriate node. If the `key` is not found in the tree, a new node is created with the `key` and `value`.\n",
      "4. The `search` method takes an `int` `key` as a parameter, and searches for the `key` in the tree. If the `key` is found, the `value` associated with the node is printed. If the `key` is not found, \"not found\" is printed.\n",
      "5. The `print` method traverses the tree and prints each node's `key` and `value`.\n",
      "6. The `findNode` method takes an `int` `key` as a parameter, and finds the node in the tree with the given `key`. If the `key` is not found in the tree, `null` is returned.\n",
      "7. The `Node` class represents a node in the tree, with a `key`, `value`, `left`, `right` field. The `Node` class is used to create and manipulate nodes in the tree.\n",
